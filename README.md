This repository demonstrates a common error in Tcl when working with lists: accessing an element using an index that is out of bounds.  The `bug.tcl` file shows the error, and `bugSolution.tcl` provides a more robust solution.  The issue is that standard Tcl list functions don't automatically handle index errors gracefully; they throw exceptions. This example shows how to improve error handling to provide better program behavior.
